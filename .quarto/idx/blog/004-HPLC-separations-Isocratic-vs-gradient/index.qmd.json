This method allows for sharper peaks throughout the chromatogram and can achieve separations that are not possible with isocratic elution. Gradients are designed to start with weak elution conditions and end with strong elution conditions, providing adequate compound retention and elution.\n\nThere are different types of gradient designs, including linear and step gradients. Linear gradients are the most commonly used and help keep each compound's band broadening to a minimum. Compounds stick to the column media until the solvent polarity is strong enough to dissolve and elute them. Step gradients are more challenging to use but can provide a complete separation of targeted compounds in narrow bands while using less solvent than linear gradients or isocratic elution.\n\nIn summary, both isocratic and gradient elution have their advantages and disadvantages. Isocratic elution is simple but limited, while gradient elution provides sharper peaks and more flexibility.
