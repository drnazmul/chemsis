One of the most common culprits is the dwell volume (Vd), aka gradient delay volume.\n\nBut what is it exactly? Basically, the dwell volume is the amount of space within the fluidic path between where your eluents (the liquids used in chromatography) are mixed and where they hit the column. This includes all the tubing, valves, mixer, the autosampler loop and other components in your LC system (see the Figure).\n\n![](system-components.png)\n\nWhy does this matter? Well, if you're doing a simple isocratic analysis (where the eluent composition doesn't change), you don't have to worry about it too much. But if you're doing gradient chromatography (where the eluent composition changes over time), the dwell volume can have a big impact on your results. If you want to maintain the retention, selectivity, and resolution of your analytes, you need to know the dwell volume of your LC system. This is especially crucial when transferring gradient methods between different instruments.\n\nDifferent LC systems have different dwell volumes (could range from 100 uL to 1100 uL), depending on things like the type of pump you're using and whether you have any mixers installed (See my other posts for pump designs). So if you're transferring a gradient method from one instrument to another, or using a different column format, you might see differences in your results because of dwell time variations.\n\nTo adjust for differences in dwell volume, we can incorporate an isocratic hold into the method or utilize an injection delay. Even if you adjust the start time of the gradient to account for the system dwell volume, you may still encounter issues with inconsistent separation selectivity. That's why it's always a good idea to confirm the identification of analyte peaks.\n\nTo make sure you're getting accurate results, it's a good idea to understand and measure the dwell volume of your LC system. That way, you can adjust your methods as needed to account for any differences between instruments.\n\n\nHey there, fellow HPLC enthusiasts! Last time we discussed the importance of determining dwell volume. Today, we're talking about dwell volume determination. It's a quick and easy way to measure the dwell volume of your HPLC system.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\nFirst things first, you'll need to replace your column with a Zero Dead Volume connector. Then, fill Solvent Line A with water and Solvent Line B with water containing 0.1% v/v acetone. Use UV detection at 265 nm to monitor the run.\n\nNext, run a gradient that's typical of the gradients you usually use in the lab. I recommend a 0-100% B gradient run over 20 minutes at 2 mL/min. Keep the injector in the inject position during this measurement, because the injector loop volume is part of the dwell volume.\n\nAfter the gradient is run, you should see a chromatogram that looks like the one below. The baseline at the beginning of the chart denotes 100% A, while the final flat baseline represents 100% B.

Draw a horizontal line from the midpoint until it intersects the rising baseline. From this intersection, drop a vertical line to the time axis.
