Mass spectral data can be displayed in different ways, depending on which aspect you want to view, such as:

- Mass Spectrum
- Total iron chromatogram
- Extracted ion chromatogram
- Base peak chromatogram


## Mass Spectrum

A mass spectrum is a two-dimensional graph showing ion signals detected by a mass spectrometer. The x-axis represents the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and the y-axis shows the signal intensity. Each mass spectrum results from a single recording event, known as a scan, in the mass spectrometer.

The highest peak in a spectrum is called the base peak. Any very small and insignificant data is referred to as noise.

## Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC)

A Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) is a graph that shows the total number of ions hitting a detector over time during a mass spectrometry analysis. Each point on the TIC represents the sum of all ion intensities detected at that specific moment. 

Imagine you're at a busy train station during rush hour, and you're interested in counting the number of people who pass through the station over time. Instead of watching continuously, you decide to take a snapshot every few seconds. Each snapshot captures a different moment in time, showing how many people were in the station at that instant.

In this analogy:

- Each snapshot represents a scan from the mass spectrometer.
- The number of people in each snapshot corresponds to the number of ions detected in that scan.
- When you plot the number of people in each snapshot on a graph, the y-axis represents the signal intensity (number of ions), and the x-axis represents time or scan number.

So, just as you would analyze the snapshots to understand the flow of people through the station, in mass spectrometry, you analyze the scans to understand the distribution and intensity of ions over time. 

In a TIC, you can see when the detector recorded more ions and when it recorded fewer ions over time. However, the TIC does not provide any information about the types of ions detected. It only shows the total ion count at each time point. 



## Extracted Ion Chromatogram (XIC)


Imagine you're observing a busy train station. You see all kinds of peopleâ€”men, women, children, people with hats, people with glasses, and so on. If you were to plot a chart of all the people you see over time, that would be like a total ion chromatogram (TIC). It captures everything.

Now, let's say you're only interested in people wearing glasses. You focus on them and make a note every time you see someone with glasses. This new chart, showing only people with glasses, is like an extracted ion chromatogram (XIC). 

In an XIC, each point on the chart represents the intensity of a specific ion, or more precisely, a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z value). This is useful because it lets you see exactly when a particular ion was detected and how strong its signal was.

So, just like focusing on people with glasses in the train station, an XIC helps you zero in on specific ions from all the data you've collected.


## Base Peak Chromatogram (BPC)

The Base Peak Chromatogram (BPC) is a way to monitor only the intensity of the ion with the highest intensity (the base peak) that hits the detector at any given time.

Imagine you are watching people at a train station. In this example, instead of counting all the people in each photo you take, you only count the type of people (from the different categories:  children, women, men,  people with glasses) who appear the most times in each photo. This people represent the ion with the highest intensity at that moment.

Just like the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC), which records the total number of ions detected over time, the BPC records how many ions of the most intense type are detected at each time point. However, remember that each data point in the BPC can come from a different type of people(or ion) with a different mass-to-charge (M/z) value. 

The BPC gives you a cleaner look because it focuses on just one type of ion per scan, making it easier to identify trends and patterns. 



## Relationship of chromatograms and mass spectra

By combining ion chromatograms and mass spectra, you can get detailed information about your analytes. The chromatogram displays how the signal intensity changes over time or with each scan. The mass spectrum, on the other hand, shows which ions are detected at specific times and how strong the signals of individual analytes are.
